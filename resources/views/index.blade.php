                        <p>To help us pick, pack and dispatch the correct products to your customers we need your help</p>
                        <p>Every product in our warehouse needs a barcode. If a product doesn’t have a barcode when you ship it to one of our warehouses, then we will add a barcode to the product packaging, which you will incur a small fee for us doing this.</p>
                        <p>This barcode is what we scan, so that we can confirm we have  correctly picked the product your customer has ordered.</p>
                        <p>To help us with this process we need you to ensure that every product you have in your store has a Barcode value defined, that matches the barcode on the product. The barcode must be unique per product, including variants.</p>
                        <p>We are unable to receive a product into our warehouse that you have not defined its Barcode value in Shopify.</p>
                        <p>Enter you license key and warehouse number at <a href="{{ route('warehouse.setting',$slug) }}">settings page</a> to connect your Shopify store to Warehouse.Space</p>
                        <p>Thanks for your assistance in helping us, ship your products perfectly every time.</p>
